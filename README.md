In this repository I worked with with data from the 2018 Formula 1 season. The data was downloaded from ergast.com in the form of a single large JSON file which contains information on the results of all 21 races from the 2018 season. 

The data is structured as a list of lists of lists of lists and so on, it is up to you to look at the data and figure out how it is structured and how best to get at the information you want.

The work includes:
- Tidy the data 
- Construct a table showing the World Drivers' Championship standings for this F1 season. This table resembles the results available on Wikipedia. 
- Construct a table that contains the cumulative points earned by each of the 10 teams at the end of each of the 21 races of the 2018 season. 
- Visualization including animated plots.
